A lot of my effort went into revisiting the CKB basics and making sure I was not just copying patterns without understanding them. I spent more time thinking through the cell model, transaction flow, and the differences between lock scripts, type scripts, and off-chain transaction construction. I realized I had been mixing those layers mentally, so I slowed down and tried to understand what the chain is responsible for versus what the frontend or tooling is responsible for.

I also started looking more seriously at agentic workflows. Instead of seeing an agent as just a code assistant, I tried to understand how it could support structured problem solving across multiple steps. I explored ideas around FiberX and agentic operations with that in mind. The main takeaway for me was that agents are more useful when they help maintain reasoning across moving parts, especially when working with contract logic, off-chain tooling, and frontend state at the same time.

I hit a few bugs and sources of confusion, especially when trying to reason about where a failure actually came from. Sometimes the issue looked like a Rust or contract issue, but it was really a misunderstanding of the transaction shape or the intended state transition. That pushed me to become more disciplined about debugging by layers.

Overall this week felt slower, but it was important. I came away with a stronger foundation and a clearer sense that understanding CKB internals is necessary if I want to use agents well on top of CKB solutions.
